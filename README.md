# Backlinks Program

This document provides information about the Backlinks Program included with autoBlogger. Please read this information carefully to understand how the program works.

## Backlinks Program Details:

- The Backlinks Program is included with all autoBlogger plans at no additional cost.

- You have the flexibility to opt into or out of the Backlinks Program at any time through the 'Manage Inputs' tab on the dashboard.

- By participating in the Backlinks Program, you grant permission for your store's link to be shared on other autoBlogger's sites. In return, their links may be shared on your site. Additionally, you are expected not to remove any links that are shared on your site as part of the program.

## What Are Backlinks?

Backlinks, also known as inbound links, are external links that point to your website. They play a crucial role in search engine optimization (SEO) by indicating your website's credibility to search engines. Quality backlinks can improve search rankings, drive referral traffic, and enhance your website's authority.

## How the Program Works:

- If you choose to join the program, a link to your store will be shared periodically at the end of other autoBlogger's blogs (from within the same back-link category), increasing your visibility and traffic.

- By joining the Backlinks Program, you agree to allow links to your store to be published at any time, but only on fellow autoBlogger's blogs.

- Additionally, your articles may feature links to other users' stores, promoting mutual benefits. By participating in the program, you acknowledge and accept the inclusion of these links and agree not to remove them. Removing back-links may result in exclusion from the program.

## Responsibility and Content Review:

- Please note that while autoBlogger facilitates the sharing of back-links, we are not responsible for the content of other autoBloggers' stores. It is your responsibility to review the linked stores and ensure their content aligns with your standards and guidelines.

- If you have any concerns about the content of linked stores or questions about the Backlinks Program, please reach out to our support team for assistance.

## Terms of Participation:

- By participating in the Backlinks Program, you agree to allow your store URL to be shared and posted on other stores' blogs, as well as accept the occasional posting of links to other stores on your blogs.

- However, you may not remove the back-links without prior consent from autoBlogger.

We value your participation in the Backlinks Program and aim to provide a beneficial and collaborative experience for all users.
